                <p>
                    I'm meant to be writing at this moment. What I mean is, I'm meant to be writing something else at this moment. The
                    document I'm meant to be writing is, of course, open in another program on my computer and is patiently awaiting my
                    attention. Yet here I am plonking down senseless sentiments in this paragraph because it's easier to do than to work on
                    anything particularly meaningful. I am grateful for the distraction.
                    The young man wanted a role model. He looked long and hard in his youth, but that role model never materialized. His
                    only choice was to embrace all the people in his life he didn't want to be like.
                    He sat across from her trying to imagine it was the first time. It wasn't. Had it been a hundred? It quite possibly
                    could have been. Two hundred? Probably not. His mind wandered until he caught himself and again tried to imagine it was
                    the first time.

                    His parents continued to question him. He didn't know what to say to them since they refused to believe the truth. He
                    explained again and again, and they dismissed his explanation as a figment of his imagination. There was no way that
                    grandpa, who had been dead for five years, could have told him where the treasure had been hidden. Of course, it didn't
                    help that grandpa was roaring with laughter in the chair next to him as he tried to explain once again how he'd found
                    it.
                    "Begin today!" That's all the note said. There was no indication from where it came or who may have written it. Had it
                    been meant for someone else? Meghan looked around the room, but nobody made eye contact back. For a brief moment, she
                    thought it might be a message for her to follow her dreams, but ultimately decided it was easier to ignore it as she
                    crumpled it up and threw it away.

                    He ordered his regular breakfast. Two eggs sunnyside up, hash browns, and two strips of bacon. He continued to look at
                    the menu wondering if this would be the day he added something new. This was also part of the routine. A few seconds of
                    hesitation to see if something else would be added to the order before demuring and saying that would be all. It was the
                    same exact meal that he had ordered every day for the past two years.
                    Green vines attached to the trunk of the tree had wound themselves toward the top of the canopy. Ants used the vine as
                    their private highway, avoiding all the creases and crags of the bark, to freely move at top speed from top to bottom or
                    bottom to top depending on their current chore. At least this was the way it was supposed to be. Something had damaged
                    the vine overnight halfway up the tree leaving a gap in the once pristine ant highway.
